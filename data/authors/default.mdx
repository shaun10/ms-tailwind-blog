Shaun Hutchins is a lifelong advocate for sustainable living and mindful consumption. With a background in finance, economics, computer science, and wellness, he has spent years researching the intersections of lifestyle, systems change, and climate impact. He writes to make abstract environmental problems personal and solvable, and is building an audience through writing, speaking, and social media platforms focused on sustainable minimalism.

Originally from Los Angeles, California, Shaun earned his Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from California State University, Long Beach, and later received his Master of Science in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He has held roles at PIMCO, GE Aerospace, Indeed, and The Walt Disney Company, where he deepened his understanding of the connections between systems, technology, and sustainability.

Shaun speaks both Japanese and Chinese, and his connection to minimalism has been deeply influenced by time spent immersed in East Asian cultures. Drawing on philosophical traditions such as wabi-sabi and Daoist simplicity, his work is shaped by a firsthand appreciation of how language, culture, and lifestyle intersect to inform more intentional, balanced living.

On weekends, you can often find Shaun hiking or helping clean up local beaches.
