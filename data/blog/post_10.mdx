Government failed us on this. We often pay up to 30-35% of our earnings to bureaucrats but they often cannot complete critical assignments. This is why the climate has changed so dramatically with little done to prevent the most harmful global climate catastrophe outcomes. Government isn't responsive. Ideally we would make polluting industries pay true cost for use of public resources. Similar to taxing the finite capacity of the atmosphere to absorb greenhouse gases. Externalities should be priced in economics. Many classical economists have formulas to compute GDP, but hardly consider harm inflicted on future generations due to non-mitigation of emissions and status quo quarterly business practices. Then what is growth but short winded elations?
