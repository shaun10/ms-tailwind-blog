Climate Pledge

To protect humanity now and for the future of our posterity I am committing to the following.

1. I pledge to limit eating red meat. I will restrict intake of cows and lambs etc.
2. If I choose to have children, I will have 3 or less.
3. I will try to use cycling or mass transit options whenever possible and to participate in efforts to expand transit.
4. I will restrict flying to only when necessary and try to limit flying to only when no other choice is available. If I do fly I will try to offset all emissions.
5. I will try my utmost to conserve energy and minimize use of heating and cooling appliances.
6. I will try my best to limit energy use to renewable sources when I have the choice. When I cannot choose I will fight for the ability to have this choice.
7. I will try to help those close to me understand these choices and the need for those able, to also join the pledge.
8. I will only consume what I need. I will not perpetuate extravagance and will only support companies who champion sustainable efforts.
9. I will do my best to strive for and support sustainable and minimalist technology.
10. I will stay involved in the public discourse on environmental issues and stay engaged on efforts to mitigate climate change.
