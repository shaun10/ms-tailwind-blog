summary: 'Our primary dependance on power generated from fossil fuels and our mass consumption of livestock mammals, has caused the greenhouse gas levels to jump up like a hockey stick and throw the climate out of balance. These human activities threw out the natural balance our planet had built over the last million years. The effects of higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are being felt globally. All of mankind is experiencing the damages humans cause by making these changes. Whether it’s sea level rise, drought, heat waves, flash flooding, wildfires, more intense storms and weather patterns, or even cold snaps we are all denizens of Earth’s climate.'

Our primary dependance on power generated from fossil fuels and our mass consumption of livestock mammals, has caused the greenhouse gas levels to jump up like a hockey stick and throw the climate out of balance. These human activities threw out the natural balance our planet had built over the last million years. The effects of higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are being felt globally. All of mankind is experiencing the damages humans cause by making these changes. Whether it’s sea level rise, drought, heat waves, flash flooding, wildfires, more intense storms and weather patterns, or even cold snaps we are all denizens of Earth’s climate.

Here are really simple easy things we could do to reduce the climatic damage we cause:

1.  Don’t use plastic bags. And minimize the use of plastic containers, cups, utensils, etc through reuse.

2.  Don’t use styrofoam or other products created through using carbon based fossil fuels.

3.  Don’t eat mammalian livestock. These domesticated animals produce methane while being grown for human consumption (Cows, pigs, lambs, etc) hard not to eat beef and pork but I have been going strong for years now with very intermittent beef consumption. (Edit I decided to give up red meat permanently. Haven’t had any beef or lamb in over three months. At first it was a struggle but now like clockwork).

4.  Don’t use plastic straws. Try to purchase a metal one to use for drinking water while dining out.
    When you drive, drive a a fuel efficient vehicle, and drive it as little as possible. My car gets 41 MPG. I was able to pull this off through strenuous efforts to use the accelerator less, glide more. Whether it’s timing red lights, driving 55 on the freeway, gliding to a stop, there are many ways to take MPG to another level. Also, whenever possible I try to carpool, use mass transportation, bike, or walk/run to destinations.

5.  Use a steel water bottle. I don’t use plastic bottles and try to avoid them like the plague because of carbon footprint as well as BPA concerns.

6.  Use biodegradable detergent and dish washing soap.

7.  Try to take quick showers 3-4 minutes with warm tepid water. Keep water heater temperature at a low. The lower the temperature of the water, the less carbon dioxide produced while keeping it warm or hot. (Combustion of natural gas will still result in the creation of greenhouse gases)

8.  Be more and more mindful of how electricity is generated. Energy generated from nuclear is great, except when it yields large quantities of nuclear waste. When electricity is generated through combustion (burning) of fossil fuels water is boiled. After the water is boiled it is compressed into a tighter and tighter amount of space within a turbine, moving the turbine as quickly as possible within the highly compressed space. This converts the kinetic energy of water into the mechanical energy of the turbine movements. Then thanks to Michael Faraday, a magnetic object is rotated or moved back and forth within an electrical generator sending out electricity through the wires into our homes. With every device we use, every appliance we turn on, we are consuming a little bit of that energy stored away within our planet. Problematically though when it is oil, natural gas, coal, or any other petroleum product, carbon dioxide is being produced. This is why it is of the utmost importance we switch away from carbon energy to safe 4th generation nuclear reactors that produce little waste and can’t meltdown along with remote solar installations where human operations are too far removed from the grid.
