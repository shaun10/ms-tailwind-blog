summary: 'A problem with climate is that we cannot actually feel how it was before. Change is therefore only experienced only in the moment.'

Living on Earth in the late 1800s felt very different from the way it feels to live on the Earth in 2016. But the problem is we don't know what it felt like back then. We can kind of imagine that there has been considerable change. We might need to define a new cognitive bias in order to describe this phenomena. That climate change is becoming more apparent and people's understanding of it improves is encouraging, but on a large scale society's actions remain relatively modest compared to the urgency of the threat.

Imagine how it might feel to have been born last year or this year. The hottest years in human recorded history. You would never know how the more temperate climate of the 1930s or 1950s felt. Your baseline would be the hottest year human's had ever felt. This might make it harder to realize how hot the last few years have been. It might even make it harder to change behavior and to have a positive impact on sustainability.
