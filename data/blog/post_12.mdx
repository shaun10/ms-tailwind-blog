June is well underway and the temperatures are starting to rise. I have enjoyed 2015 so far. There have been a lot of big challenges at work and at school. But that's the way life is, it's never going to be easy but it's always worth it. I will start to write lessons I learn through my studies, work, and personal experience on this site. Time will always be limited, but it is important to keep information stored on this Blog that can be referenced over time.
