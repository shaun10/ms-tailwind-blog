Our information is everywhere. We exists in 1000s of databases across a wide set of industries. There are times we sign up for a service at one point in our life that we don't end up using later on. Like finite events in our lives, data should have a finite life. Non-criminal data should pass in time if governments permit it.

Citizens should be able to choose to have their data purged from databases when they terminate a relationship with an enterprise if regulatory authorities have no stipulations concerning the data.

Security breaches have become too numerous because many, mostly non-tech companies do not sufficiently secure their systems. As a result an individuals private data is often leaked sometimes long after the service was used.

Private personal data should be purged or archived if a relationship is terminated and if regulatory authorities have no concerns.

An app that seeks to protect an individuals private data by allowing the user to choose and track where their most sensitive data is stored would be both necessary and beneficial.
