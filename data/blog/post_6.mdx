Good afternoon distinguished representatives,

I just wanted to take a moment and express my concern with a potential measure before the council next week concerning the reemergence of wood burning fire rings in Corona Del Mar and Newport Beach. I commend the efforts already taken to promote public health and well being by banning wood burning at beaches.

Whenever we think of wood burning we need to remember a few things:

Smoke may smell good, but itâ€™s not good for you. Wood smoke can affect everyone, but children, teenagers, older adults, people with lung disease, including asthma and COPD or people with heart diseases are the most vulnerable.

Smoke is made up of a complex mixture of gases and particles produced when wood and other organic matter burn. A major health threat from smoke comes from fine particles (also called particle pollution, particulate matter, or PM). These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system, where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes, runny nose, and illnesses such as bronchitis. In addition to particle pollution, wood smoke contains several toxic harmful air pollutants including: benzene, formaldhyde, acrolein and methane.

Why would anyone want to bring this back? Allowing wood burning on beaches exposes residents and visitors who choose not to partake in wood burning to harmful pollutants and carcinogens. This is similar to the choice not to allow second-hand smoking in public parks and public restaurants.

On the issue itself:

When the science proves there are serious health and environmental risks to a public activity we need to take those risks into consideration when creating public policy. By creating and enforcing rules that protect the overall health and well being of those in the affected area, we are setting healthy air standards that impact our entire community. There are many recreational burning alternatives available that do not produce the toxins caused by wood smoke. These alternatives should be at the forefront of our discussions in the 21st century. Moving forward with technology and science advancements, not lingering in a more harmful past before we knew how severe the health impacts of wood smoke are.

Thanks,
