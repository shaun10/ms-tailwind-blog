summary: 'The realization of your dreams and goals.'

Throughout my adolescent and adult life I dreamed of doing many things. Of accomplishing many feats, of becoming a successful individual, of traveling to different places on Earth. Sometimes after many of these goals have been realized one is left with a sense of happiness and a bit of nostalgia. We realize time has passed and a chapter is behind us.

Eventually the feeling passes and we wonder what's next in our lives. We have to continue to seek wonder and joy in life. I often feel the best way to do this is to continue to learn and better appreciate the small things in life. There are a finite number of countries on Earth one can visit. But within ones own city and career path there can be infinite depth if one is able to keep the door to their mind open.
