I like the idea of the White House petitions, but honestly I do not think it is enough to accurately reflect public overall sentiment.

I have an idea of a white house petition leading to a white house online vote. This online vote could be active for a week and announced via different types of media sources. Lets say the public is to vote on interesting national public debate items such as homelessness, gun control, US involvement in Syria, budget issues etc.

There are times when action is often avoided by legislaturers because it is difficult to gauge overall public sentiment as well as lobbyist who are pushing against the new proposals.

The fundamental problems we have to overcome are getting from great ideas to action as well as overcoming the political stalemates and overall inaction. Congress and Senate is often too removed from the daily lives of citizens. By having a sort of process where great ideas arenâ€™t just submitted but are then removed once going through a political process then considered for overall feasibility and debated, constituents would be more connected to the democratic process.

Washington would be more responsible for moving past the lobbying and gridlock it faces. They would be more directly responsible for addressing the citizens concerns and ideas for a better system.

I wish something like this were to exist and that somehow the White House Petitions could eventually become votes where people submit their responses then the results are tallied and if the overall majority wants a topic addressed Congress will review and issue a response, vote. Members would be directly responsible for their votes/responses and help responsible by their constituents during the next election seasons.
